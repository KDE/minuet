cmake $KDE_SRC -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIRS -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# How to Create Minuet Screencasts

1) Start Minuet using qsynth as backend.
2) Qsynth should be configured to use pulseaudio as audio backend.
3) Make sure minuet MIDI output port is connected to qsynth.
4) Use simplescreenrecorder application with pulseaudio backend, "Monitor of Built-in Audio Analog Stereo" source, MP4 container, and MP3 codec (256 bitrate).
